# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs capture decisions that could be questioned later. They keep the project intentional and explain “why” beyond code and tests.

## When to write an ADR

- Choosing a framework/library when alternatives exist (and it’s not the obvious default).
- Any deviation from conventional practice.
- Cross-cutting concerns (auth strategy, data model shifts, infra approach).

## Format

- Short and readable; see the template.
- Include context, decision, alternatives, consequences, and follow-ups.

## How to add

1) Copy `template.md` to `docs/adr/NNNN-title.md` (increment NNNN).
2) Fill it in.
3) Link from this README if useful.
