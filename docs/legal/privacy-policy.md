## Information We Collect

We collect a limited amount of information in order to operate the app:

- **Account information:** An email address provided during registration.
- **Account activity:** Information generated through normal use of the app, such as league participation, draft activity, and other in-app actions associated with your account.
- **Technical information:** Basic technical data such as IP address, session identifiers, and similar information required to operate and secure the service.

## How We Use Information

We use the information we collect solely to operate and improve the app. This includes:

- Creating and managing user accounts
- Supporting leagues, drafts, and other core features
- Communicating service-related information
- Maintaining security and preventing abuse

We do not sell user information or use it for advertising or marketing purposes.

## Data Retention

We retain personal information only for as long as it is necessary to operate the app and support user accounts. Information associated with an account is generally retained while the account remains active.

## Data Deletion Requests

You may request deletion of your account and associated personal information by contacting us. We will make a good-faith effort to delete information that is no longer required to operate the service, subject to any legal or operational obligations.

## Age Eligibility
