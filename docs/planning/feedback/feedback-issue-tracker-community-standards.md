# Community Standards

## Purpose
The Fantasy Oscars community exists to surface high‑quality ideas, issues, and feedback that meaningfully improve the product. These standards define the expectations for participation and explain how community health is protected.

These standards are themselves part of the product. Participation implies agreement with both the rules *and* their enforcement mechanisms.

## Core Principles

1. **Good‑faith participation**
   - Engage constructively and honestly.
   - Assume others are acting in good faith unless clearly demonstrated otherwise.

2. **Signal over noise**
   - Contributions should aim to advance understanding or improve the product.
   - Redundant or low‑effort content may be moderated to preserve signal quality.

3. **Respectful conduct**
   - Harassment, abuse, or hostility toward other users or moderators is not permitted.
   - Disagreement is allowed; disrespect is not.

4. **Transparency of enforcement**
   - Moderation actions are guided by documented policy.
   - Moderators are human and may err; feedback on moderation decisions is allowed through defined channels.

## What to Expect from Moderation

- Moderation actions are taken by humans, not automatically.
- The system may assist moderators with context and guidance, but moderators make final decisions.
- Actions are proportional, documented, and reversible in principle.

---

## Appeals & Feedback

- Users may respectfully contest moderation decisions.
- Appeals are evaluated based on policy, not outcomes.
- The feedback system itself is open to critique.

---

## Open Questions / Future Decisions

- Final wording and tone calibration (aspirational vs minimal).
- Exact public visibility of reputation indicators.
- Whether and how to surface moderation rationale to users in‑product.
