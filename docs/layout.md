# Layout Conventions

## Breakpoints

Breakpoints are centralized in `apps/web/src/theme/index.ts` under `appTheme.breakpoints`.

Do not introduce ad hoc breakpoint numbers in feature code.

## Layout primitives

Reusable layout wrappers live under:

- `apps/web/src/ui/layout/`

Use these to keep spacing and gutters consistent across pages.
